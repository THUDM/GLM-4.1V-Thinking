## Introduction

Vision-language models (VLMs) have become a key cornerstone of intelligent systems. As real-world AI tasks grow increasingly complex, VLMs urgently need to enhance reasoning capabilities beyond basic multimodal perception ‚Äî improving accuracy, comprehensiveness, and intelligence ‚Äî to enable complex problem solving, long-context understanding, and multimodal agents.

Through our open-source work, we aim to explore the technological frontier together with the community while empowering more developers to create exciting and innovative applications.

**This open-source repository contains our `GLM-4.5V` and `GLM-4.1V` series models.** For performance and details, see [Model Overview](#model-overview). For known issues, see [Fixed and Remaining Issues](#fixed-and-remaining-issues).

## Project Updates

Connects to the GLM multimodal API for intelligent services across scenarios. Download the [installer](https://huggingface.co/spaces/zai-org/GLM-4.5V-Demo-App) or [build from source](examples/vlm-helper/README.md).

## Quick Start

The following steps apply to NVIDIA GPUs. For inference on Ascend NPUs, see [here](https://modelers.cn/models/Models_Ecosystem/GLM-4.5V).

### Environment Installation

For `SGLang` and `transformers`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For `vLLM`:

```bash
pip install -U vllm --pre --extra-index-url https://wheels.vllm.ai/nightly
pip install transformers-v4.55.0-GLM-4.5V-preview
```

### transformers

- `trans_infer_cli.py`: CLI for continuous conversations using `transformers` backend.
- `trans_infer_gradio.py`: Gradio web interface with multimodal input (images, videos, PDFs, PPTs) using `transformers` backend.
- `trans_infer_bench`: Academic reproduction script for `GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking`. It forces reasoning truncation at length `8192` and requests direct answers afterward. Includes a video input example; modify for other cases.

### vLLM

```bash
vllm serve zai-org/GLM-4.5V \
     --tensor-parallel-size 4 \
     --tool-call-parser glm45 \
     --reasoning-parser glm45 \
     --enable-auto-tool-choice \
     --served-model-name glm-4.5v \
     --allowed-local-media-path / \
     --media-io-kwargs '{"video": {"num_frames": -1}}'
```

### SGlang

```shell
python3 -m sglang.launch_server --model-path zai-org/GLM-4.5V \
     --tp-size 4 \
     --tool-call-parser glm45 \
     --reasoning-parser glm45 \
     --served-model-name glm-4.5v \
     --port 8000 \
     --host 0.0.0.0
```

Notes:
- We recommend using the `FA3` attention backend in SGLang for higher inference performance and lower memory usage:  
  `--attention-backend fa3 --mm-attention-backend fa3 --enable-torch-compile`  
  Without `FA3`, large video inference may cause out-of-memory (OOM) errors.  
  We also recommend increasing `SGLANG_VLM_CACHE_SIZE_MB` (e.g., `1024`) to provide sufficient cache space for video understanding.
- When using `vLLM` and `SGLang`, thinking mode is enabled by default. To disable the thinking switch, add:  
  `extra_body={"chat_template_kwargs": {"enable_thinking": False}}`

> The special tokens `<|begin_of_box|>` and `<|end_of_box|>` in the response mark the answer‚Äôs bounding box in the image. The bounding box is given as four numbers ‚Äî for example `[x1, y1, x2, y2]`, where `(x1, y1)` is the top-left corner and `(x2, y2`)` is the bottom-right corner. The bracket style may vary ([], [[]], (), <>, etc.), but the meaning is the same: it encloses the coordinates of the box. These coordinates are relative values between 0 and 1000, normalized to the image size.

## Model Fine-tuning

[LLaMA-Factory](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory) already supports fine-tuning for GLM-4.5V & GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking models. Below is an example of dataset construction using two images. You should organize your dataset into `finetune.json` in the following format, This is an example for fine-tuning GLM-4.1V-9B.

```json
[
  {
    "messages": [
      {
        "content": "<image>Who are they?",
        "role": "user"
      },
      {
        "content": "<think>\nUser asked me to observe the image and find the answer. I know they are Kane and Goretzka from Bayern Munich.</think>\n<answer>They're Kane and Goretzka from Bayern Munich.</answer>",
        "role": "assistant"
      },
      {
        "content": "<image>What are they doing?",
        "role": "user"
      },
      {
        "content": "<think>\nI need to observe what these people are doing. Oh, they are celebrating on the soccer field.</think>\n<answer>They are celebrating on the soccer field.</answer>",
        "role": "assistant"
      }
    ],
    "images": [
      "mllm_demo_data/1.jpg",
      "mllm_demo_data/2.jpg"
    ]
  }
]
```

1. The content inside `<think> ... </think>` will **not** be stored as conversation history or in fine-tuning data.
2. The `<image>` tag will be replaced with the corresponding image information.
3. For the GLM-4.5V model, the <answer> and </answer> tags should be removed.
  
Then, you can fine-tune following the standard LLaMA-Factory procedure.

## Model Overview

### GLM-4.5V

GLM-4.5V is based on ZhipuAI‚Äôs next-generation flagship text foundation model GLM-4.5-Air (106B parameters, 12B active).  
It continues the technical approach of GLM-4.1V-Thinking, achieving SOTA performance among models of the same scale on 42 public vision-language benchmarks.  
It covers common tasks such as image, video, and document understanding, as well as GUI agent operations.

![bench_45](resources/bench_45v.jpeg)

Beyond benchmark performance, GLM-4.5V focuses on real-world usability. Through efficient hybrid training, it can handle diverse types of visual content, enabling full-spectrum vision reasoning, including:
- **Image reasoning** (scene understanding, complex multi-image analysis, spatial recognition)
- **Video understanding** (long video segmentation and event recognition)
- **GUI tasks** (screen reading, icon recognition, desktop operation assistance)
- **Complex chart & long document parsing** (research report analysis, information extraction)
- **Grounding** (precise visual element localization)

The model also introduces a **Thinking Mode** switch, allowing users to balance between quick responses and deep reasoning. This switch works the same as in the `GLM-4.5` language model.

### GLM-4.1V-9B

Built on the [GLM-4-9B-0414](https://github.com/zai-org/GLM-4) foundation model, the **GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking** model introduces a reasoning paradigm and uses RLCS (Reinforcement Learning with Curriculum Sampling) to comprehensively enhance model capabilities.  
It achieves the strongest performance among 10B-level VLMs and matches or surpasses the much larger Qwen-2.5-VL-72B in 18 benchmark tasks.  

We also open-sourced the base model **GLM-4.1V-9B-Base** to support researchers in exploring the limits of vision-language model capabilities.

![rl](resources/rl.jpeg)

Compared with the previous generation CogVLM2 and GLM-4V series, **GLM-4.1V-Thinking** brings:
1. The series‚Äô first reasoning-focused model, excelling in multiple domains beyond mathematics.
2. **64k** context length support.
3. Support for **any aspect ratio** and up to **4k** image resolution.
4. A bilingual (Chinese/English) open-source version.

GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking integrates the **Chain-of-Thought** reasoning mechanism, improving accuracy, richness, and interpretability.  
It leads on 23 out of 28 benchmark tasks at the 10B parameter scale, and outperforms Qwen-2.5-VL-72B on 18 tasks despite its smaller size.

## Fixed and Remaining Issues

Since the release of GLM-4.1V, we have addressed many community-reported issues. In GLM-4.5V, common issues such as repetitive thinking and incorrect output formatting are alleviated.  
However, some limitations remain:

1. In frontend code reproduction cases, the model may output raw HTML without proper markdown wrapping. There may also be character escaping issues, potentially causing rendering errors. We provide a [patch](inference/html_detector.py) to fix most cases.
2. Pure text Q&A capabilities still have room for improvement, as this release focused primarily on multimodal scenarios.
3. In some cases, the model may overthink or repeat content, especially for complex prompts.
4. Occasionally, the model may restate the answer at the end.
5. There are some perception issues, with room for improvement in tasks such as counting and identifying specific individuals.

We welcome feedback in the issue section and will address problems as quickly as possible.
